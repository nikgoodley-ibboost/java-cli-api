To specify parameters accepted by your Command implementation, annotate field members of the class by using [JCommander](http://jcommander.org/) annotations.

An example of this is seen in the [AddUserCommand](http://code.google.com/p/java-cli-api/source/browse/trunk/sample-cli-client/src/main/java/com/ballew/samples/cli/client/commands/AddUserCommand.java) contained within the Sample CLI Client.
